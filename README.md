# Closet Manager App

# Description

The Closet Manager app is an Android application that allows users to view and manage a list of clothing closets. The main screen displays a scrollable list of default closets loaded from a CSV file (`Closets.csv`), and users can add new closets through a secondary screen. The app is designed with simplicity in mind, avoiding RecyclerViews, and instead dynamically adds closet buttons to the main layout. Each closet button is functional and designed to eventually lead to a separate outfit management view.
