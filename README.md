# Threadly
## Closet Manager App

## Description

Threadly is an Android application that allows users to view and manage a list of customized closets. On the main screen, users can access their saved closets and add new closets, giving them a name for ease of use. Inside each closet, the user can add any outfits they create and give them names as well. To build an outfit, the user can take a picture of each piece of clothing making up that outfit and save it locally to the app. These articles of clothing will be displayed in the outfit view and the user can add multiple to each outfit, or the user can delete any of them.

## How to Run the App

Open the app, press the continue arrow on the entry screen. Select the closet you want to view, or add/delete a closet. Build the outfit by taking a picture of each article of clothing to view it in the app. Select an outfit you want to view or create a blank outfit. Also deleting for any item in the app must be done on its respective screen. For example deleting a closet will not delete the outfits inside. The outfits must be deleted first for deletion to be succesfull, this also goes for outfits and their respective clothing items.
